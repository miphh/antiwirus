# antiwirus

A simple antivirus program written in VB.NET

## Getting started

This startup guide will explain how to get AntiWirus up and running on your computer.

## Important

Because I do not own a digital certificate, Windows SmartScreen will block the executable from running. I have VirusTotal scans as proof that this isn't a virus.

Also note that this is an **ALPHA** release

### Installing

AntiWirus is a Windows application, so you won't be able to use it on Mac or Linux. To get started, download the installer listed on the Releases page. From there, install the program like you normally would for any other program. After that, you're all set to start testing AntiWirus.

## Features

AntiWirus has many features that are still being tested and developed. It would be great if you could provie feedback so we could impove these features.

### awtray.exe

awtray is a program that will run in your application tray. this works together with realtimeprot.dll to scan for threats in real time. This is an experimental feature.

### realtimeprot.dll

realtimeprot.dll is a real time protection library that is used by awtray.exe

## Feedback

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! :)
